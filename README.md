## 0.3.0-alpha

This is just the program itself, all intitrid scripts are mostly taylored to the latest 0.2.x version and will most likely not work with 0.3.0 due to breaking changes in the CLI interface.
I've decided it release the version in this state since I just do not have the time now or in the forseeable future to tewak all scripts since it's quite an tedious tasks which involves rebooting VMs countless times.
If you're interested to adapt or write scripts for an particular distro I'd be more than happy to accept pull requests.
